# NvChad Config
This is my fork of the NvChad config files. 

## Installing:
Remove the custom folder after installing NvChad, 
then clone this repo there. 

## Note: 
### For angularls:
All projects must have package language server from angular. Install via this command: npm i install @angular/language-server@16.2.0
